## Development Principles

### Core Values
1. **Privacy First**: All features respect user privacy
2. **Local First**: Core features work offline
3. **Performance**: Fast, lightweight, efficient
4. **Simplicity**: Easy to use, not overwhelming
5. **Open Source**: Transparent, community-driven

### Decision Framework

#### When Adding Features
✅ Does it solve a real user problem?
✅ Is it aligned with core mission?
✅ Can it be implemented securely?
✅ Will it maintain performance?
✅ Is it accessible to all users?

❌ Feature bloat for sake of features
❌ Copying competitors blindly
❌ Compromising privacy/security
❌ Breaking existing workflows
❌ Making UI too complex
