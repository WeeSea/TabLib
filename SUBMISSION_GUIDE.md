# Quick Start: Chrome Web Store Submission

This guide will walk you through publishing TabLib to the Chrome Web Store step-by-step.

---

## üöÄ Pre-Flight Checklist (Do This First!)

### 1. Create PNG Icons (CRITICAL - Must Do!)

Your current icons are SVG format. Chrome Web Store requires PNG.

**Action Required**:
```bash
# Create icons folder
mkdir icons

# Convert SVG to PNG using one of these methods:

# Option A: Online tool (easiest)
# 1. Go to https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
# 2. Upload icon16.svg, set width to 16px, download as icon16.png
# 3. Upload icon48.svg, set width to 48px, download as icon48.png
# 4. Upload icon128.svg, set width to 128px, download as icon128.png
# 5. Move all PNGs to icons/ folder

# Option B: ImageMagick (if installed)
magick icon16.svg -resize 16x16 -background none icons/icon16.png
magick icon48.svg -resize 48x48 -background none icons/icon48.png
magick icon128.svg -resize 128x128 -background none icons/icon128.png
```

**Verify**: You should now have:
- `icons/icon16.png`
- `icons/icon48.png`
- `icons/icon128.png`

### 2. Update Manifest (Already Done!)

The manifest.json has been updated to reference `icons/` folder. Once you create the PNG files, you're good to go!

### 3. Create Store Graphics

**Required** (Do this next):

#### A. Small Promotional Tile (440x280px)
**Quick method**: Use Canva
1. Go to https://canva.com
2. Create custom size: 440x280px
3. Add:
   - Background: Blue gradient (#1a73e8)
   - Title: "TabLib - Advanced Tab Manager"
   - 3-4 key features with icons
   - Your 128px icon
4. Download as PNG
5. Save as `store_assets/promotional_440x280.png`

#### B. Screenshots (1280x800px)
**Quick method**: Built-in Chrome
1. Open TabLib (Ctrl+Shift+Space)
2. Press F12 (DevTools)
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+M (Device toggle)
4. Set dimensions: 1280x800
5. Click ‚ãÆ menu > Capture screenshot
6. Repeat 3-5 times showing different features:
   - Main interface with tabs
   - Search feature in action
   - Multi-selection
   - Window optimization modal
   - Different view modes
7. Save as `store_assets/screenshot1.png`, etc.

### 4. Host Privacy Policy

**Option A: GitHub Pages** (Recommended)
1. Create GitHub repository for TabLib
2. Push code including PRIVACY_POLICY.md
3. Go to Settings > Pages
4. Enable GitHub Pages
5. Your policy will be at: `https://yourusername.github.io/tablib/PRIVACY_POLICY.html`

**Option B: Google Sites** (Easy, no GitHub needed)
1. Go to https://sites.google.com/new
2. Create new site
3. Copy content from PRIVACY_POLICY.md
4. Publish
5. Note the URL

**Option C: Your Own Website**
- Host PRIVACY_POLICY.md on any web server
- Make sure it's accessible via HTTPS

### 5. Update Manifest with Your Info

Replace placeholders in manifest.json:
```json
"author": "Your Name",  // Change this!
"homepage_url": "https://github.com/yourusername/tablib",  // Change this!
```
