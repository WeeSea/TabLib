## ⚠️ Action Required (Before Submission)

### CRITICAL - Must Do:

#### 1. Create PNG Icons (Required!)
Your icons are currently SVG. Chrome Web Store requires PNG.

**Action**:
```bash
# Create icons folder
mkdir icons

# Convert using online tool (easiest):
1. Go to https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
2. Convert icon16.svg → icon16.png (16x16)
3. Convert icon48.svg → icon48.png (48x48)
4. Convert icon128.svg → icon128.png (128x128)
5. Save all to icons/ folder
```

**Verification**: You should have `icons/icon16.png`, `icons/icon48.png`, `icons/icon128.png`

#### 2. Update Manifest Placeholders
Edit [manifest.json](manifest.json):
```json
"author": "Your Name or Company",  // ← Change this!
"homepage_url": "https://github.com/yourusername/tablib",  // ← Change this!
```

#### 3. Create Store Assets

**A. Small Promotional Tile** (440x280px PNG - Required)
- Use Canva or similar tool
- Include extension name, icon, and 3-4 key features
- Save as `store_assets/promotional_440x280.png`
- See [STORE_ASSETS.md](STORE_ASSETS.md) for detailed guide

**B. Screenshots** (1280x800px - Need 3-5)
- Capture TabLib in action
- Show: main interface, search, multi-select, optimization, view modes
- Save as `store_assets/screenshot1.png`, etc.
- See [STORE_ASSETS.md](STORE_ASSETS.md) for how-to

#### 4. Host Privacy Policy
Upload [PRIVACY_POLICY.md](PRIVACY_POLICY.md) to:
- **GitHub Pages** (recommended), or
- **Google Sites** (easy), or
- **Your own website**

Note the URL - you'll need it for store listing!

#### 5. Register Developer Account
- Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/
